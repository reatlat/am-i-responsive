A high fidelity preview of your responsive design across Desktop, Laptop, Tablet and Mobile.

I take a lot of screen shots of the various device breakpoints for responsive design and it takes a while to prepare them. This tools allows me to get what I need quickly, and hopefully it can be helpful for showing your more visual clients what you mean by responsive design when a suite of products isn't at the ready.

This is not a tool for testing, it is really important that you do that on real devices. This instead is a tool for quick screenshots (for me) and to visually allow people to “get” what you mean in client meetings.
